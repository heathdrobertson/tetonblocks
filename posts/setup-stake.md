# [Staking] to TETON [Cardano] Stake Pool

__Help me strengthen and make the [Cardano] public blockchain more secure by
delegating your stake to the [TetonBlocks] TETON pool.__

**What is [Cardano] [Staking]?**

[Staking] is an alternative consensus mechanism (way to verify and secure transactions) that allows the [ADA] coin holders to secure the [Cardano] public blockchain with minimal energy consumption and setup. [Cardano] uses an incentivized staking mechanism to ensure the longevity and health of the network and ecosystem. Shelley is the upgrade which enabled [Cardano] staking.
